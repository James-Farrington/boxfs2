This software is licensed under the GPLv2 Licence and
comes with NO WARRANTY. Use at your own risk.

Compiling
=========

Unpack the source tarball and run make in the resulting dir.
You need FUSE and libxml2 (most distros come with them installed).
You can get libxml2 from xmlsoft.org.


Usage
=====

Usage: boxfs [options] [mountPoint] [FUSE Mount Options]

Common options:
  -H                show optional FUSE mount options
  -u login          box.net login name
  -p password       box.net password
  -f conffile       file containing configuration options

File passed in -f option can have lines such as:
username = mrsmith
mountpoint = /path/to/folder
password = secret

Lines beginning with '#' are treated as comments and ignored.

If you don't specify username and/or password nor in the command line neither in configuration file, you will be prompted for them.
You must provide the mountpoint, after the other options or in the configuration file.

When you've done using your files, unmount your filsystem
with fusermount -u mountpoint
